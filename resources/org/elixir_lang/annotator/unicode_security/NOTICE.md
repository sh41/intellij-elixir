# Unicode data for Elixir's identifier rules

Each `identifiers-<Unicode version>.tsv` beside this file lists the code points above 127 that Elixir's tokenizer
accepts in an identifier, with their script sets, for one Unicode version. They were derived by
`src/org/elixir_lang/annotator/unicode_security/generate.exs`, which also writes this file, from the Unicode
Character Database files in `lib/elixir/unicode/` of
https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir,
with a port of the table-building part of that repository's `lib/elixir/unicode/tokenizer.ex`. That file is
